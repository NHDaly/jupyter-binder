    "### Setting up the recurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent neural net is *recurrent* because the simple model is repeated multiple times to create the overall model, carrying state from each step to the next. This is called \"unrolling\" the net.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters, because in order for backpropogation to calculate the effect that the hidden state has on the loss, it needs to take the changes from one `state` to another into account when calculating the gradient. If you didn't unroll the network, and instead just returned the `state` from each run and passed the `state` back into the next run, the `state`'s only effect on the cost would be how the `state` effected `y`, not how the current `state` effected the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the simple network without unrolling it looks like this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$  cost = truth - y $, where $ y = W_{hy}*h' $ and $h' = tanh(W_{hh}*h + W_{xh}*x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The current state, $h$, only effects $cost$ through it's impact on $y$. Even though it sets the *next state*, $h'$, the transition from $h$ to $h'$ is never considered during backpropogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, an *unrolled* network *does* effect the cost both from the current $h$ and on its effect on the next $h$. Consider a network unrolled for 2 steps, $x_0$ and $x_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$  cost = (truth_1 - y_1) + (truth_0 - y_0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "for $ y_1 = W_{hy}*h_2 $, $h_2 = tanh(W_{hh}*h_1 + W_{xh}*x_1) $\n",

    "and\n",
    "$ y_0 = W_{hy}*h_1 $, $h_1 = tanh(W_{hh}*h_0 + W_{xh}*x_0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $W_{hh}$'s impact on $h_1$ is reflected in the `cost`, alongside its impact on $y_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "SO, I *think*, the more steps you unroll a network for before doing backpropogation, the more emphasis you're placing on the hidden state's impact versus the other weights."

The larger this is, the more data it will take to train, but it will possibly be able to learn features that are more spread out in time (such as opening and closing brackets, maybe). On the other hand, if this is tiny, it will get feedback for each character and can learn with far less data, but might not learn spelling/structure as well.\n",

    "Alright! Let's run it! We set up a loop below which iterates through the text, one batch of `seq_length` characters at a time. For each batch, it runs `update`, which trains the RNN by iterating through the batch, backpropogating, and updating the weights using gradient descent. Each training step needs to operate on a batch, because unrolling the RNN for all the characters in the batch is what makes the Recurrent Neural Network *deep* -- and, as I understand it, being deep is what makes backpropogation/gradient descent somehow magically be a decently bowl-shaped space."
